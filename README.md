## Overview

This course will cover the essential elements of distributed, concurrent systems and build upon that knowledge with engineering principles and practical experience with state-of-the-art technologies and methods for building scalable systems. Scalability is an essential quality of Internet-facing systems, and requires specialized skills and knowledge to build systems that scale at low cost. 

## Course Delivery

This site contains all the informtion for the course, except the quiz questions.
Class will meet each week for 3 hour 20 mins. Classes will be a mix of lectures and labs.

## Course Book

The book for the course, Foundations of Scalable Systems, is available for purchase at your favorite retailers, eg [here](https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Scalable-Systems-Distributed-Architectures/dp/1098106067/ref=asc_df_1098106067/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=564700895175&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11230893476443846738&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9033322&hvtargid=pla-1643586021023&psc=1).

# Policies

**Late Submission**
If you need more time, come beg :). Communications usually give a positive outcome.
Without warning, you'll lose 5% of your final grade each day overdue. 

**Missed Quizzes**
Quizzes last approximately 45 minutes. If you are not able to attend and take the quiz at the same time as others, _you must let your instructor know_ in advance. Failure to do this will result in a zero for the quiz you miss. 

**Do your own work**
You know the rules. Helping each other out is fine, but design and build and test your own system. Any unwarranted collaboration will result in a zero grade for the assignment. 

**Code of Conduct and Course Values** 
No disrespect, rudeness, or abuse will be tolerated, either in class or in online communication. During class, we will be doing a lot of sharing of ideas and open-ended work. It is important that everyone feel comfortable contributing to class discussion, and that their contributions are valued. To that end, our course values can be defined as: 
*	Respect 
*	Inclusion 
*	Support 
*	Kindness
